What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  It creates a .git file where you may use git commands. It creates an empty git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area shows the files that we are ready to commit. The working directory is the directory where all our files are and the repo shows all of the commit objects.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
  I can use the staging area to view what changes have been made and decide whether to commit them or not.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
  Branches are useful when makin changes that may not be in the final program. An example could be making the program run in a different language.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  With diagrams you can clearly see where branches have been made. You can also very clearly see where they haven't been made. It helps put a list of names into perspective when you can view it as a diagram.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
  When we merge the two branches, we get the changes made from both of the branches. In the game, we now have colors and coins :)
