When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are working on a huge project you might only need certain files. If there is multiple people working on a project, they may only need certain files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not need all the files/ be the one working on them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones are copies of the repo on the local computer. branches are different/alternate versions perhaps adding new features and forks are used to propose changes to someone elses project/ to use it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It means you have the latest version of the project stored locally

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Merging branches without github would suck :(

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you wanted o add features to your project it would be sensible to add it to a new branch rather than working on the master.
