When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are working on a huge project you might only need certain files. If there is multiple people working on a project, they may only need certain files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not need all the files/ be the one working on them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clones are copies of the repo on the local computer. branches are different/alternate versions perhaps adding new features and forks are used to propose changes to someone elses project/ to use it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It means you have the latest version of the project stored locally

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Merging branches without github would suck :(

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    If you wanted o add features to your project it would be sensible to add it to a new branch rather than working on the master.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want all the changes that are on the on the remote repo

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Forks are useful when you want to take someone elses work and add to it. Branches are good when you want to add a new feature to a program but it's not ready for the master version yet. cloning is useful when you need to download a repo locally to edit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    You can work off the latest version soif you have to work offline for  while, you are already on the latest version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    Sharing files through another service like google drive. Could be easy but merging changes would be much harder, however saving files would be much easier. In saying that you can't go into detail with changes unless you comment inside the file itself.
